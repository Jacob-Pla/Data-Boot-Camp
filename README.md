Final Project For Data Analytics Boot Camp
The data for this porject was found on kaggle.

The initial steps for the project was to import my libraries and data set into jupyter notebook as most of my analysis would be done in python. I did a quick overview in microsoft word just to familiarize myself with the data set. 

After this I noticed the 2019 data set was not a clean data set. I removed columns last_review and reviews_per_month as they had 10k plus nulls values each. Then removed the remaining null rows.
